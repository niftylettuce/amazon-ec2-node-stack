## Amazon EC2 Configuration

1. Sign up for Amazon's [free trial](http://aws.amazon.com/free/) for EC2.
2. Import your key pair to the [AWS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home#s=KeyPairs).

    > You need to have a public/private [key pair](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys) generated.

3. Click "Launch Instance" at the [AWS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home#s=Instances).

        * Launch a new "micro" instance from "Quick Start" with 64-bit "Ubuntu Server 12.04.1 LTS".
        * Continue through using the defaults until you reach the "Create Key Pair" step.
        * Select the radio button for "Choose from your existing Key Pairs".
        * From the dropdown menu, you should be able to select the SSH public key you uploaded in step #2.
        * Continue through defaults and launch your instance.

4. Copy the instance's "Public DNS" ("hostname") to your clipboard.

    > (e.g. Public DNS: `ec2-12-345-67-89.compute-1.amazonaws.com`)

5. Load up a new terminal window and paste the hostname for a `ssh` conneciton.

    ```bash
    ssh ubuntu@ec2-12-345-67-89.compute-1.amazonaws.com
    ```

    > Type "yes" when you are the prompt asks, "Are you sure you want to continue connecting?".

    > Once you are successfully connected, the prompt will say hello:

    ```bash
    The authenticity of host 'ec2-12-345-67-89.compute-1.amazonaws.com (12.345.67.89)' can't be established.
    ECDSA key fingerprint is ab:cd:ef:gh:jk:lm:no.
    Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
    Warning: Permanently added 'ec2-12-345-67-89.compute-1.amazonaws.com,12.345.67.89' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.

6. Set the time based on your local.

    ```bash
    sudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata
    ```

7. Update and upgrade all existing packages.

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
    ```


## Ubuntu Security Configuration

1. Connect over SSH to your EC2 instance (see [Amazon EC2 Configuration](#amazon-ec2-configuration) step #5).
2. Change the port for SSH and disable remote root login:

    ```bash
    sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
    ```

    > Edit "sshd_config" with the following changes:

    ```diff
    # What ports, IPs and protocols we listen for
    +Port 44444
    -Port 22
    ```

    ```diff
    # Authentication:
    LoginGraceTime 120
    +PermitRootLogin no
    -PermitRootLogin yes
    StrictModes yes
    -#PasswordAuthentication yes
    +PasswordAuthentication no
    ```

    ```bash
    sudo service ssh restart
    ```

    > Since you changed the port to 44444, next time you SSH you'll need to connect with the `-p 44444` flag.

3. Setup `fail2ban` to automatically ban malicious IP addresses:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install fail2ban
    sudo cp /etc/fail2ban/jail.conf /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
    sudo vim /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
    ```

    > Edit "jail.local" with the following changes:

    ```diff
    [ssh]

    enabled  = true
    +port     = 44444
    -port     = ssh
    filter   = sshd
    logpath  = /var/log/auth.log
    maxretry = 6
    ```

    ```diff
    [ssh-ddos]

    +enabled  = true
    -enabled  = false
    +port     = 44444
    -port     = ssh
    filter   = sshd-ddos
    logpath  = /var/log/auth.log
    maxretry = 6
    ```

    > After saving the file, restart the `fail2ban` process:

    ```bash
    sudo service fail2ban restart
    ```

4. Log in to the EC2 Security Group management <https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home#s=SecurityGroups>

5. Remove inbound port 22 and enable port 44444 for your server's security group.

    > This will serve as our new SSH port (feel free to change port number above/throughout these steps).

6. Enable automatic security updates.

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install unattended-upgrades
    sudo vim /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/10periodic
    ```

    Edit "/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/10periodic":

    ```diff
    APT::Periodic::Update-Package-Lists "1";
    +APT::Periodic::Download-Upgradeable-Packages "1";
    -APT::Periodic::Download-Upgradeable-Packages "0";
    +APT::Periodic::AutocleanInterval "7";
    -APT::Periodic::AutocleanInterval "0";
    +APT::Periodic::Unattended-Upgrade "1";
    ```

7. Install and configure logwatch to email you the daily logs:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install logwatch
    sudo vim /etc/cron.daily/00logwatch
    ```

    ```diff
    #execute
    +/usr/sbin/logwatch --output mail --mailto your@email.com --detail high
    -/usr/sbin/logwatch --output mail
    ```


## Node.js with HTTP Proxy Configuration

This tutorial assumes that you've already installed Node.

1. Connect over SSH to your EC2 instance (see [Amazon EC2 Configuration](#amazon-ec2-configuration) step #5).

    > Note that you may need to add the flag `-p 44444` if you disabled normal SSH access on port 22 in the previous section.

2. Configure upstart:

    > Create a new file `/etc/init/cluster.conf`

    ```bash
    sudo vim /etc/init/cluster.conf
    ```

    ```bash
    #!upstart

    description "cluster"
    author "ubuntu"

    start on runlevel [2345]
    stop on runlevel [016]

    # restart when job dies
    respawn

    # give up after 5 respawns in 60s
    respawn limit 5 60

    # start the script and log output
    script
      exec sudo node /home/ubuntu/cluster/server.js >> /var/log/cluster.log 2>&1
    end script
    ```

3. Install http-proxy:

    ```bash
    mkdir /home/ubuntu/cluster
    cd /home/ubuntu/cluster
    npm install --save http-proxy
    ```

4. Setup http-proxy cluster:

    > Create a new file `/home/ubuntu/cluster/server.js`

    ```bash
    sudo vim /home/ubuntu/cluster/server.js
    ```

    ```js
    var cluster   = require('cluster')
      , numCPUS   = require('os').cpus().length
      , sites     = require('./sites')
      , httpProxy = require('http-proxy')

    var options = {
        hostnameOnly: true
      , router: sites
    }

    if (cluster.isMaster) {
      for(var i=0; i < numCPUS; i+=1) {
        cluster.fork()
      }
      cluster.on('exit', clusterExit)
    } else {
        var proxy = httpProxy.createProxy()
        require('http').createServer(function(req, res) {
            proxy.web(req, res, {
                target: sites[req.headers.host]
            })
        }).listen(80)
    }

    function clusterExit(worker, code, signal) {
      console.log('worker %d died', worker.process.pid)
    }
    ```

5. Add a test virtual host with your EC2's Public IP to a new file `/home/ubuntu/cluster/sites.js`:

    ```js
    module.exports = {
      "12.34.56.78": "http://127.0.0.1:3000"
    }
    ```

6. Start cluster:

    ```bash
    sudo start cluster
    ```

7. Test to ensure that cluster is working properly.

    ```bash
    npm install -g http-server
    http-server -p 3000
    Starting up http-server, serving ./ on port: 3000
    Hit CTRL-C to stop the server
    ```

    > Now visit <http://12.34.56.78/> (replace with your instance's IP).  If you run into issues, you may need to log into EC2's security groups and open up port 3000.


## Apache Legacy Support

If you need to support legacy web applications running on PHP/Apache/MySQL, then we can setup Apache to run on an alternate port such as 8080.

1. Install dependencies including Apache, PHP, and MySQL.

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install apache2 php5 libapache2-mod-php5 mysql-server phpmyadmin
    ```

2. Modify the default port from 80 to 8080:

    ```bash
    sudo vim /etc/apache2/ports.conf
    ```

    > Edit "/etc/apache2/ports.conf":

    ```diff
    +NameVirtualHost *:8080
    -NameVirtualHost *:80
    +Listen 8080
    -Listen 80
    ```

    ```bash
    sudo vim /etc/apache2/sites-available/default
    ```

    > Edit "/etc/apache2/sites-available/default":

    ```diff
    +<VirtualHost *:8080>
    -<VirtualHost *:80>
    ```

3. Reload the Apache configuration and restart the server.

    ```bash
    sudo service apache2 reload
    sudo service apache2 restart
    ```

4. Add a virtual host to `sites.js` (replace "mysite.com" with your domain):

    ```bash
    vim /home/ubuntu/cluster/sites.js
    ```

    ```diff
    module.exports = {
        "12.34.56.78": "127.0.0.1:3000"
    +  , "www.mysite.com": "127.0.0.1:8080"
    +  , "mysite.com": "127.0.0.1:8080"
    }
    ```

5. Add a virtual host to `/etc/apache2/sites-available/mysite.com`:

    ```bash
    sudo vim /etc/apache2/sites-available/mysite.com
    ```

    ```conf
    <VirtualHost *:8080>
      ServerAdmin	your@email.com
      ServerName	mysite.com
      ServerAlias	www.mysite.com
      DocumentRoot /home/ubuntu/mysite.com
    </VirtualHost>
    ```

6. Create the virtual host folder and a test index file:

    ```bash
    mkdir /home/ubuntu/mysite.com
    vim /home/ubuntu/mysite.com/index.html
    ```

    ```html
    <h1>MySite.com</h1>
    ```

7. Enable the virtual site and reload Apache.

    ```bash
    sudo a2ensite mysite.com
    sudo service apache2 reload
    ```

8. Enable mod rewrite.

    ```bash
    sudo a2enmod rewrite
    sudo service apache2 restart
    ```

9. Visit <http://mysite.com> to test out the http-proxy with Node to Apache.
